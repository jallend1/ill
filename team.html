                <h3>Lending</h3>
                <p>Sure, we borrow books from other libraries across the country. But we ALSO own a lot of books that other libraries want to borrow. Openly sharing our items with other systems grants means that other libraries will do the same for us, maximizing the number of locations we can try to borrow books for you without any charge.</p>
                <p>Jay is the fella in charge of getting the materials The Generic Public Library owns into the hands of the libraries that want it.</p>
                <p>Also, lose or damage an interlibrary loan book you borrowed? He's gonna be the guy you want to talk to in order to figure out what the replacement cost for that item is going to be. Send him an email and let him know!</p>

                <h3>Borrowing</h3>
                <p>The borrowing side is the part of interlibrary loan that connects The Generic Public Library's patrons to materials that we don't own. It's the primary reason interlibrary loan exists!</p>
                <p>Bea is the one in charge of tracking down items our patrons want, and scouring the nation's libraries for a copy that is available for us to borrow.</p>
                <p>She always tries to borrow books for free, but some libraries do charge us a fee. We will never just assume you're okay with that, and will reach out to you to make sure before we go forward.</p>
                <p>Want to check on the status of an item you've requested? Please reach out to her, and she'll be happy to help!</p>

                <p>Kay has her finger in a lot of pots in the interlibrary loan department! But her primary focus is on connecting our patrons with copies of articles and geneaology requests.</p>
                <p>Aside from that, she's also responsible for preparing and entering some of the books we borrow for our patrons into our own database system so that they can be easily checked out once they arrive at the branch for pickup.</p>
                <p>Reach out to Kay if you are looking to get a copy of an article!</p>

                <h2>Vee</h2>
                <h3>Shipping</h3>
                <p>The books we lend and borrow have to get here somehow, and that's where Vee comes in.</p>
                <p>She processes all of our outgoing USPS, UPS, and FedEx shipping needs.</p>
                <p>Once our patron is done with an item we've borrowed, Vee carefully and securely packages the item for shipping.</p>
                <p>We prefer to use Library Mail from the United States Postal Service, but some libraries, like the Library of Congress, require us to send items to them through a different service.</p>
                <p>Vee keeps track of all that, and also handles the packaging and shipment of all items of our own that we are lending to other systems.</p>
                <p>Want some more behind the scenes into Vee's process? Send her a message!</p>
