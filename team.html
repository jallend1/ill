                Sure, we borrow books from other libraries across the country.
                But we ALSO own a lot of books that other libraries want to
                borrow. Openly sharing our items with other systems grants means
                that other libraries will do the same for us, maximizing the
                number of locations we can try to borrow books for you without
                any charge.

                The borrowing side is the part of interlibrary loan that
                connects The Generic Public Library's patrons to materials that
                we don't own. It's the primary reason interlibrary loan exists!

                Bea is the one in charge of tracking down items our patrons
                want, and scouring the nation's libraries for a copy that is
                available for us to borrow.
